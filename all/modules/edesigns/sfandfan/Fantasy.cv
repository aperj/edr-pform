But now, Gaius Sextus, First Lord of Alera, grows old and lacks an heir. Ambitious High Lords plot and maneuver to place their Houses in positions of power, and a war of succession looms on the horizon.""

Caught in a storm of deadly wind furies, Tavi saves the life of a runaway slave named Amara. But she is actually a spy for Gaius Sextus, sent to the Valley to gather intelligence on traitors to the Crown, who may be in league with the barbaric Marat horde. And when the Valley erupts in chaos - when rebels war with loyalists and furies clash with furies - Amara will find Tavi's courage and resourcefulness to be a power greater than any fury - one that could turn the tides of war.",,military fantasy,

Then Gaius falls ill, leaving those closest to him, including Tavi, desperate to keep his weakness secret. With Cursors being murdered, an ancient menace known as the ""vord"" heading for the capital and civil war on the horizon, Tavi has his work cut out for him. Butcher skillfully weaves in the necessary back story without slowing the pace. Solid world-building, intriguing characters and vivid action make this a solid addition to a marvelously entertaining series. ",,military fantasy,

Gaius Sextus, the First Lord of Alera, plants his nephew Tavi in a new legion, where Tavi can gather information on the rebellious High Lord of Kalare. Tavi, now a full-fledged Cursor, or spy, infiltrates the legion under the assumed identity of an officer, a station the green young man has not yet actually achieved. Treachery from a supposed ally opens the legion to attack from its bestial enemies, the Canim, incapacitating the captain and catapulting Tavi to the rank of the legion's commanding officer. Cut off from contact with the First Lord and with few seasoned officers to guide him, he must lead the troops in a defense of the Imperium against a horde of frenzied Canim warriors set on annihilating the Aleri people.

Two years into a difficult campaign against the wolflike Canim invaders, Calderon legion captain Tavi is saddled with an unqualified but politically powerful superior whose plans threaten disaster and force Tavi into potential treason. Meanwhile, aging ruler Gaius Sextus plans a final strike against the rebellious lord of Kalare, but to get close enough to act, he must set aside his power to control the elements and make a painful overland slog that neatly challenges genre conventions. Butcher deftly deploys intrigue, conflicted loyalties and hairbreadth action to excellent effect. Few writers balance military realism and cinematic swashbuckling with so much skill or wit.

The insectile Vord hold far too much of the land, including areas that surrendered willingly. Alera’s old enemies, the Canim, are now allies, which makes both reluctant partners tense. Certain Alerans of rank persist in nattering over whether Tavi is the rightful ruler. And Tavi’s lover, Kitai, insists on being properly courted to maintain respectability in Aleran eyes. With Tavi trying to keep ahead of one quandary after another and find a way to defeat the Vord, and with various intriguers met in the previous five volumes trying to salvage their schemes, the pace here is much faster than in the immediately preceding Cursor’s Fury (2006), Captain’s Fury (2007), and Princeps’ Fury (2008)",,military fantasy,

Only the combined efforts of a young man dedicated to finding the truth, an enigmatic woman intent on concealing her past, and a crusty old hermit resigned to his inevitable destiny can prevent the opening of the three boxes of Orden-an event with the potential to destroy existence itself.

In the earlier book, Seeker of Truth Richard Cypher tricked the sorcerer Darken Rahl by using Wizard's First Rule (that people are stupid and can be easily misled) into opening the wrong Box of Orden. Though this saved humanity from the evil mage's tyrannies, it also tore the veil between worlds, so the diabolical Keeper of the Underworld can now reach through and seize permanent control of the living. To stop this from happening, Richard must now learn how to be a wizard. The Sisters of the Light promise they will teach him to wield his powers, but they require that he wear a collar of obedience, something he has sworn he would rather die than do. Events sweep Richard and his betrothed, the Mother Confessor Kahlan Amnell, apart from one another; later, in one of the most vigorous battle sequences written for a heroine in modern fantasy, Kahlan leads her underage troops against battle-hardened soldiers, the young warriors naked except for a spectral coat of whitewash intended to make them look like ""spirits.""

,Book,0765331721,Jo Walton,Walton,Among Others,,,,,2011,"Starred Review. World Fantasy Award–winner Walton (Tooth and Claw) turns the magical boarding school story inside out in this compelling coming-of-age tale. Welsh teen Morwenna was badly hurt, and her twin sister killed, when the two foiled their abusive mother's spell work. Seeking refuge with a father she barely knows in England, Mori is shunted off to a grim boarding school. Mori works a spell to find kindred souls and soon meets a welcoming group of science fiction readers, but she can feel her mother looking for her, and this time Mori won't be able to escape. Walton beautifully captures the outsider's yearning in Mori's earthy and thoughtful journal entries: ""It doesn't matter. I have books, new books, and I can bear anything as long as there are books."" Never deigning to transcend the genre to which it is clearly a love letter, this outstanding (and entirely teen-appropriate) tale draws its strength from a solid foundation of sense-of-wonder and what-if.",2012 Nebula Award winner,,

But this is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a seeing of the unseen. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, Borlú is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman’s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them more than their lives.

Wounded in battle, Latro has only one day's worth of memory and must write down his experiences so he will know who he is every morning. In compensation, he's able to see gods and supernatural beings and does not distinguish them from the mortals around him. Gaps in the record and Wolfe's Haggardesque device of the manuscript found in a jar make Latro the most postmodern of unreliable narrators, aware that he's writing a text, uncertain of its meaning and unable to keep its entirety in his head. For all Wolfe assures us that ancient Egypt is not mysterious, Latro's journey makes up a leisurely, dreamlike, haunted house of a novel, which brilliantly immerses the reader in the belief systems of the time, drifting in and out of the everyday and spirit worlds until the two become indistinguishable.",WFA 2007,,

Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky.
